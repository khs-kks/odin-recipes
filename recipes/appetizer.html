    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Caprese salad (Italian: insalata caprese [insaˈlaːta kaˈpreːze; -eːse] or simply caprese) is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, and olive oil.</p>
    <p>A refreshing appetizer for the summer, my family loved this so much they ate more than a serving each. Also great for those who love the flavor of caprese but aren't huge fans of tomatoes.</p>
