    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Guacamole is a staple of Mexican cuisine. Although it is pretty simple to make,
        it can be tough to get the perfect flavor.
        With this authentic Mexican recipe, though, you will be an expert in no time.</p>
    
    <p>Guacamole (Spanish: [(ɡ)wakaˈmole];
        (informally shortened to guac in the United States since the 1980s) is an avocado-based dip,
        spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine,
        it has become part of international cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.</p>
